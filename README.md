# AutoDL
Auto download YouTube video's with YouTube-DL (Automating progress for YT)

## Installing
It's just one line (must be running as root!):

curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhognl/AutoDL/master/install.sh -o /tmp/install.sh && bash /tmp/install.sh && rm /tmp/install.sh


## How To Use
To run AutoDL, just use the command 'autodl' as normal user. If you want to install, remove or update, just run the above script.
You can add the video URL's to the file /ytdownloads/list.txt. Then run AutoDL and that's it.
